Kp values are not readily archived in text-row format outside of the operational database, which makes post-storm analysis difficult without the aid of a database administrator to query the database on behalf of the forecaster. This python script will automatically pull 3 hourly Kp values from a json file staged at swpc.services.gov every 5 hours and append to a '3hrKp' database (sqlite) for access by the forecaster. The database can be accessed through a SQL or Python command interface (using sqlite3 library) or using DB Browser for SQLite (GUI app).
